This is a super basic word counter I made as a learning project. It counts the frequencies of each word and then summarizes that into a total word count.

It auto detects mode based on the file extension. The only currently supported (that is, it filters out syntax) file extension is .tex (LaTeX). I'm probably not going to make more, since it would be trivial. 
Any other file extensions get treated as any old text-file.
